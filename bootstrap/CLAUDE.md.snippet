## Priors

This project uses agent priors (`.claude/priors/`) — persistent knowledge the agent accumulates across sessions.

**Start of every task:** List `.claude/priors/` and read each file's YAML frontmatter (`topic`, `summary`). Load full content only for files relevant to the current task.

**End of every conversation** where you were corrected, discovered something unexpected, or the user provided context you couldn't derive from code: load the `knowledge-extraction` skill from `.claude/skills/` and extract priors.
